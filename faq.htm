<u>Where can I get the latest Hero Lab FAQ information?</u></font></p>
<p align="left">
      You should be able to find the information you need at the <a href="http://www.wolflair.com/index.php?context=hero_lab">Hero Lab web site</a>. The information there may be more up to date than this FAQ, so if your question isn't answered here, check there too.

<u>Why doesn't this include all the content from the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual?</u></font></p>
<p align="left">
      Hero Lab includes everything in the 5th Edition SRD, such as races and their traits, character classes and class features, spells, equipment, magic items, and other character creation necessities. It also includes all of the monsters and DM mechanics outlined in the SRD.<br>
      <br>
      For those of you not familiar with the SRD, it differs from the rules presented in the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon’s Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. Specifically, the SRD omits certain options that appear in the full rulebooks (e.g. certain spells, feats, etc.), so those options cannot be included in Hero Lab. Fortunately, Hero Lab’s customizability allows users to fill in the holes and readily go beyond the limits of the SRD.<br>
      <br>
      We are also still pursuing an official license with Wizards of the Coast to support the entire 5th Edition product line. If an official license can be secured, anyone purchasing the SRD option for Hero Lab will be given the option to upgrade.

<u>How do I get access to content from supplement books?</u></font></p>
<p align="left">
      Unfortunately we can't offer 5th Edition supplement books for sale at this time. Sorry!<br>
      <br>
      You can purchase additional data packages for other Hero Lab game systems by selecting "Purchase Data Package" from the "License" menu. Once purchased, reactivate your license from the License menu - once Hero Lab restarts, you should have access to the new content.

<u>Can I create characters on Hero Lab for the iPad?</u></font></p>
<p align="left">
     Hero Lab for iPad is now available, allowing you to create and advance player characters and NPCs on your iPad! With a Hero Lab license, you can create, advance, and play 5e characters and NPCs just like you can on your Windows or Mac computer. We've adapted the familiar Hero Lab interface for iPad, allowing you to build characters just as easily as you can on your desktop or laptop.<br>
     <br>
     Without a Hero Lab license, characters can be used in-play, but not created or advanced. For example, you can't add levels to characters on an iPad without a Hero Lab license. To do so, copy the character back to your desktop or laptop computer and add them there.

      Buy all three together for $9.99, or separately for $3.99 each, on our online purchase site!</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Enhancements &amp Changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom monsters can now be swarms. To make a custom monster a swarm, just set the size of the individual member of the swarm.</li>
      <li>Subraces can now modify the size of the character.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Races were still reporting that skill proficiencies needed to be slected when the Background Proficiency and Personality Trait Proficiency options were active.</li>
      <li>The text for temporary hit points has been updated. Also, having more than one active temporary HP pool will now cause an error.</li>
      <li>The factions table would sometimes be hidden on the backround tab.</li>
      <li>Range values were hidden in the editor for magic weapons.</li>
      <li>Height and weight from subraces weren't overwriting height and weight values for the base race.</li>
      <li>Racial spells, item spells, and spell-like abilties weren't appearing correctly in the custom XML output.</li>
      <li>Scimitars were missing the wGroup.Sword tag.</li>
      <li>Custom abilites for custom monsters weren't displaying their description text on the printed character sheet.</li>
      <li>Natural armor no longer stacks with worn armor.</li>
      <li>Configurables with spells to print weren't appearing on the printed output.</li>
      <li>The error message requireing Adventurer's League characters to use either the standard array or the point-buy attribute method had a typo.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Data File Authoring</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Campaign settings can now be created in the editor - if any are present, the user can select a setting on the "Configure Hero" form. To create a campaign setting, choose "Overrides: Setting" when creating a Mechanics thing (this adds the Mechanics.Setting tag). As well as acting like any other mechanics pick, a campaign setting can do other setting-related things like rename things to be specific to a setting. For example, "perform state.thing[lCommon].amendthing[name,"Westish"]" will rename the Common language to Westish, if your setting has everyone knowing Westish instead of Common.</li>
      <li>Custom XML output now includes elements for "racespells" (spell abilities added by the race), "itemspells" (spell abilities added by magic items), and "spelllike" (spell abilities added from other sources, like class abilities). See the updated custom output DTD for more details.</li>
      <li>Changes have been made in the way swarms are handled. Now, to create a swarm creature, you assign it the type of the base creature, and add the size of the individual creature.</li>
      <li>The DoubSave tag group has been added for saves. This allows a creature to add double its proficiency bonus to a saving throw.</li>
      <li>The AbilModify tag group has been added. This tag group is intended for tags that modify the behavior of specific abilities and can be added to. For example, if a creature can hover while flying, then the AbilModify.Hover tag would be applied to its flight ability. This replaces the following tags currently in use:
        <ul>
          <li>Helper.Hover is replaced by AbilModify.Hover</li>
          <li>Helper.BlindBeyo is replaced by AbilModify.BlindBeyo</li>
          <li>Helper.TouchRange is replaced by AbilModify.TouchRange</li>
          </ul>
        Note that the existing tags still work as intended. Their use is no longer reccomended however.</li>
      <li><b>NOTE:</b> Prevously, proficiencies with tools granted by races, backgrounds, etc. were handled by assigning ProfTool tags to the pick, which were then forwarded to the hero. This method is no longer supported. The new way of handling tool proficiencies is to bootstrap the tool from the pick with the Proficienc.Tool tag assigned on the bootstrap. Existing proficiencies will need to be converted over to the new method. Otherwise they won't show up on the printed character sheet or the specials tab in Hero Lab.</li>

    <h3>Enhancements &amp Changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Temporary hit point pools have been added. Now temporary hit points from sources such as the <i>false life</i> spell can be tracked.</li>
      <li>Keeping track of projects undertaken during downtime has been added. This can be found under "Optional Rules" on the configure hero window - when this rule is enabled, a new "Downtime" tab appears. Now users will be able to keep track of long-term projects taken between adventures, such as the crafting of magic items or the construction of keeps and strongholds.</li>
      <li>Custom monsters can now set their multitattack text in the "Custom Monster Details" section of the race tab. This will be displayed in the stat block and Special tab as normal. If your creature can attack simultaneously with claws, a bite, and a stinger attack, you'll be able to see it.</li>
      <li>The tiefling's infernal legacy ability has been split into three separate abilities. This will make it easier for variant tieflings to replace individual spells granted by this ability.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Magic weapons and armor now weigh as much as the base item by default.</li>
      <li>On the background tab, if the same background trait was rolled twice, deleting one of them would leave you with a trait that couldn't be deleted.</li>
